# CCSDS

## A sandbox for working with Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)-formatted data

#### Purpose

This is a brief introduction to and sandbox for working with CCSDS packets. The vast majority of 
space utilizes the CCSDS standard as the golden rule for all data transmitted to and from on-orbit 
systems, as well as between subsystems on said systems.

Reading through the packet standard is simple enough, but actually working with the packets can 
prove difficult the first time through. This is a first pass at my own attempts in working with 
the standard from scratch - implementing the header packing algorithms, payload packing algorithms, 
payload unpacking algorithms, and header unpacking algorithms. 

The end goal of this is to bolster my own familiarity and capabilities working with these packets 
as well as providing a sandbox that can be cloned to provide a truth baseline from which others 
may begin their own CCSDS journeys.
